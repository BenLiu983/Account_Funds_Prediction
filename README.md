## 1. Overview

* The objective is to predict the future funds balance of clients owning multiple accounts after 6 months.
* Implemented multiple ML regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost) with MLflow and HyperOpt, to develop the optimal model.
* Yielded a satisfying Power Ratio (0.94), which measures the ranking capability of the models (counterpart of AUC for classification tasks).
> Due to NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement), the dataset was manually generated to closely mimic the structure of real-world data.
